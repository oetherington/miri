MIRI IMAGE FILE FORMAT
Tiny and simple image file format for easy implementation in other programs.
The miri program itself is used to convert other popular file formats to miri
files.

SPECIFICATION
The first 4 bytes of a miri file consist of the ASCII signature "miri". This
may also be used as an endianness check. The second and third 4 byte chunks are
32 bit integers containing the width and height of the image respectively.
Immediately after this is the image data itself which is always stored as RGBA
whether or not there is actually any alpha data. The number of bytes of image
data is therefore the width times the height times four.

LICENSE
Miri is in the public domain - see "COPYING" for details.
stb_image from <https://github.com/nothings/stb> is also bundled with miri and
is also available in the public domain.
